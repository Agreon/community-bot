Welcome all newcomers! This announcement is highlighting our bespoke bot, @PascalCaseBot. It is an open-source community developed bot built specifically for this server. It has a lot of amazing features described below:

- Reputation: This is probably the biggest feature. It's a infinite points based system. You can give 3 reputation per day, the command to do this is t!rep [@user]. To get your/someone else's rep, do t!getrep <@user>. We also have a leaderboard, accessible with t!leaderboard (t!lb too). You can also view your/somebodys reputation history (how they got all their rep) with t!history <@user>. To see how much more rep you can give on the current day, you can do t!remaining.

✔ Autorole: You can get experience and helper roles in #roles @done(20-08-01 05:00)

- Reminders: You can set a reminder by writing t!reminder [length] <reason>. At the end of the time, it will send you a dm, so make sure you have dms enabled.

✔ Playground: You can do t!playground [code] (t!pg too) to generate a playground link for the given code. Along with this, when the bot detects a long playground link, it will automatically shorten it down into an embed. @done(20-08-01 03:14)

✔ Polls: Prefix your message with poll: and it will automatically react with poll reactions @done(20-08-01 02:24)

It also has a bunch of server management features, such as automod and logging. We also just hit 500 members (:tada:)! Anyway, thats all from me. Big things coming in the future! (@everyone)
