# Contributing

See the [documentation](https://cookiecord.js.org/) for the framework we use.

We also have a docker-compose.yml for development, along with a .env.example.

**A quick note about the help channel system:** Please don't use it if you don't have a really big server (10k+ members) as it will inconvinence your members more then the benefit it'll bring. We used a static channel system (#help-1 and #help-2) up until around 9,000 members, when we started to see issues arrising (many questions being aksed ontop of eachother without answers).

## Thanks!

-   [ronthecookie](https://github.com/ronthecookie) for writing the base for the bot and the amazing [framework](https://github.com/cookiecord/cookiecord) used!
-   [Python Discord](https://github.com/python-discord) for heavily influencing our help channel system.
